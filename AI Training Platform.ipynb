    "A TensorFlow \"cluster\" is a set of \"tasks\" that participate in the distributed execution of a TensorFlow graph. Each task is associated with a TensorFlow \"server\", which contains a \"master\" that can be used to create sessions, and a \"worker\" that executes operations in the graph. A cluster can also be divided into one or more \"jobs\", where each job contains one or more tasks\"\n",
